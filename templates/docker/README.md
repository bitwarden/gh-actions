# Docker Workflow Templates

There are currently 2 types of templates:
- Product Templates
- Service Templates

### Product Template
This can be used when docker images are released as a product to the public.<br/>
See the [product folder's README](./product/README.md) for more information.

### Service Template
This can be used when docker images are pushed as an internal service that supports either internal tools or the SAAS product.<br/>
See the [service folder's README](./service/README.md) for more information.
