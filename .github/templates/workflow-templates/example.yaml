# Workflow templates are based on starter workflows provided by github at
# https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main and customized to
# represent common practices used on ACME repositories.

# This imaginary workflow runs two steps and illustrates a number of options that we use throughout workflows in the Bitwarden repositories

    # If using this, include the .github/workflows/check-run.yml job and target only the main branch
