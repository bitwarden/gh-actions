# Workflow templates are based on starter workflows provided by github at 
# https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main and customized to 
# represent common practices used on Bitwarden repositories.

# The Scan Workflow enables you to trigger SAST and quality scans directly 
# From the GitHub workflow.

name: Scan

on:
# Controls when the workflow will run

# Can use other triggers such as multiple events, activity types and fiters: 
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on
  workflow_dispatch: # When triggered manually

  push: # On push to the following branches.  Temporarily add a development branch to prompt workflow runs for troubleshooting
    branches:
      - "main"
      - "rc"
      - "hotfix-rc"
  pull_request_target: # When a pull request event occurs. Default is opened or reopened unless otherwise specified, as below:
    types: [opened, synchronize] # Other options include labeled, unlabeled, reopened

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains the jobs "check-run", "sast", and "quality" 
  # This job is relatively simple and just imports a previously written action to be used in this workflow
  check-run: # You set this value with the name of the job you're describing
